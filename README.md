# KnowledgeRooms

**KnowledgeRooms** is a collaborative learning platform built using Django, where users can create study rooms to discuss various topics, share resources, and learn together.

As my first website and project, **KnowledgeRooms** aims to facilitate a community-driven approach to learning, allowing users to create and join rooms based on their interests and educational needs.
